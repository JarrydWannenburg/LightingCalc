# LightingCalc
A repository for the LightingCalc for the LAMP Project which can be found online [here](https://uga-lighting-calc.shinyapps.io/lightingcalc/)

LightingCalc was created to determine how much electricity is required to reach the target DLI every single day of the year. To do so, a lighting system would need to be designed to provide enough light on even the darkest day of the year. On the Electricity Cost page, users will view a dashboard that calculates lighting costs at an annual, monthly, and weekly view. To use this web-based tool, you can add a location anywhere in the US and provide your electricity rate at that location ($/kWh). Add the daily light integral (DLI) you want to achieve and a greenhouse design to get estimated electricity cost results.

NOTE: If downloading the code, you will need to create your own API keys for the application to work.
